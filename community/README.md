# How to Contribute

We encourage heavy **community** involvement around this project. We strongly believe in the power of **open source**, so we're planning on building the best possible code generators, together with the entire development community.

If you like this project, feel free to contribute on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/teleporthq/teleport-code-generators)

We envision different types of involvement from this point on:
* Trying out the generators and reporting back any bugs and potential points of improvement
* Contributing to the existing issues, either on the core modules or on the existing generators and plugins
* Exploring and building new plugins for the existing generators
* Exploring and building new generators based on the existing architecture

### Something missing?

Reach out to us!
- [Open a PR](https://github.com/teleporthq/teleport-documentation) to fix the docs or to add something new to them
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/teleporthq/teleport-code-generators/issues) on the code generators project

### Transparent process and planning
**Technical decisions** were made and will be made in the future. Our process will be as **transparent** as possible as we strongly believe in **open source** and transparency. Hence, our entire planning and thinking process is done on github, where we invite the **community** to join, in an effort to develop the code generators ecosystem as reliably and as stable as possible. Considering that our aim is to build a community around our open source code, we decided to build a modular architecture and a plugin based system that allows us to decompose our code generators into smaller parts that can be re-assembled in new ways.

# Core

A project generator converts a [ProjectUIDL](/uidl/#project-uidl) into an in-memory structure of files and folders. The core package that implements the project generation algorithm is `teleport-project-generator`. This section of the docs is dedicated to explaining the [project generation flow](/project-generators/#project-generation-flow) and specifying [the interface](/project-generators/#api-reference) of the project generator object.
